This library was built to communicate with a web server to send all the information about where the User has navigated.

To use this library you have to change the web server address.

Open the file and go to the line 4. 
var webServer = ''
You have to write here the address.

After that just include this JS on your website, you should include this file on all pages that you wish to track.

The function on line 6 'sendContact' is responsible to send to the web server the information about who is the user that you are tracking.
